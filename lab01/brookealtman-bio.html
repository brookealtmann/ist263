My name is Brooke altman, I am an Innovation, Society, and Technology major with a concentration in project management and a minor in marketing. I am interested in learning more about how technology shapes businesses worldwide and how AI is continuing to impact them in both positive and negative ways. I am proud to say that I started my journey in Marketing and social media this past summer and have continued to take my studies very seriously, engaging with Syracuse University. I love to hang out with my friends and family and watch TV and movies nightly! My favorite food is sushi, and I have a golden retriever dog named George who is my best friend! I am extremely excited to finish out my next two years of college at Syracuse and cannot wait for what's to come in the future!
