        <h2>Personal Info</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Brooke Altman, I am an <strong>Innovation, Society, and Technology</strong> major with a concentration in project management and a minor in marketing. I am interested in learning more about how technolgoy shapes buisnesses worldwide, and how artifical intelligence is continuing to impact our society in both positive and negative ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am glad to report that I began my professional life in marketing and social media this summer, diving into the field of digital marketing and developing my skills in a quickly changing profession. During my time as an intern, I got hands-on experience and insights into social media strategy, influencer interaction, content generation, and analytics. I am also committed to finishing my education at Syracuse University, where I am actively engaged with the course material and using what I have learned in real life. This hands-on experience, paired with my academic concentration, is helping me in building a strong foundation in Marketing that will influence my future profession.    <p>

        <p>
            I love to hang out with my friends and family and watch TV and movies nightly! My favorite food is sushi, and I have a golden retriever dog named George who is my best friend! I am extremely excited to finish out my next two years of college at Syracuse and cannot wait for what's to come in the future!
